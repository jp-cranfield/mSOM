## Objectives
To investigate the suitability of conventional clustering methods (K-means) for metabolic time-series data; and then compare with a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Evaluate the appropriateness of conventional measures to assess cluster quality. Investigate the use of additional biological information (common metabolic pathways) to classify types of clusters.
